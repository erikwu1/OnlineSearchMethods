Online minimum search for Brownian motion and the Cauchy process: Multiple approaches

The file "MonteCarloAndGSSSearchMethods" encompasses some search method algorithms outlined in the above paper (in Sections 2 and 3, that is). Most of the algorithms
iteratively utilize the Golden Section Search or Monte Carlo Bisection Methods, but some functions like "f" are helper functions to simulate the Brownian bridge, among
other purposes. 

When running any of the functions, simply call the function with the associated parameters described in the multiline comments in the beginning of the body of each
function definition. 

These algorithms were created by Erik Wu under the advisory of Professor Shannon Starr.
